# Polygon Tessellation

This project stemmed out of an svg animation I was working on to animate hexagons
on a screen. The goal is to fully abstract this to an n-sided polygon of any size
and color that can be rendered inside of an HTML element.

Currently, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 sided polygons are stable.

To run this, you can simply download the folder and run the index.html file in
your browser.

## To Do

- [x] Produce an n-sided polygon of any color.
- [x] Implement collision detection for any even sided polygonal tessellation
- [ ] Improve collision detection to include odd sided polygons
- [x] Implement logic to create non-overlapping patterns for polygons besides triangle, square, hexagon
- [ ] Abstract to apply to any parent HTML element.
- [ ] Add more interesting animations and utility.
